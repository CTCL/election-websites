When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue with the owners of this repository before making a change.

## Reporting bugs

Please report bugs you find via GitHub issues.

A bug report should consist of:

* A descriptive title
* Steps to reproduce the problem (what you clicked, tapped, typed, saw and heard)
* What happened ("actual results")
* How this differed from what you expected to happen ("expected results")

When relevant, include configuration information (such as "Chrome 85 on macOS"), URLs and screenshots.

## Getting started

1. Clone the repository from GitHub
1. Install [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/)
1. Install [Node and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/)
1. Run `composer install`
1. Run `npm install`
1. Run `npm install -g grunt` (you may need to use `sudo`)

## Tools

This project uses Grunt, SASS, ESLint, stylelint and PHPCS. PHP modules are installed using Composer. JavaScript modules are installed using node.

## Local development

We use [VVV](https://varyingvagrantvagrants.org/) for local development. This is not a requirement, but you may find it helpful.

The [Query Monitor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/query-monitor/) plugin is recommended in development and staging environments.

Ensure your hostname ends with `.test`, such as `elections.test`.


### VVV configuration

In your `config.yml` file;

* Under `Utilities`, uncomment the `- php74` line
* Place a block like this:

```
elections:
  repo: https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/custom-site-template.git
  allow_customfile: true
  nginx_upstream: php74
  hosts:
    - elections.test
```

## Branches

* Create feature and bugfix branches off of `master`.
* Name branches `fix/xyz` or `feature/abc`, depending on the type of work being done.
* Test branches locally, and then merge into `develop` to test on staging.
* Open a pull request to merge your branch in to `master`.

Be sure to run `phpcs` and fix all warnings before committing.

## Commits

* Use descriptive commit messages.
* Commit compiled CSS and JS files separately from source files.

## Releases

* Ensure version numbers have major, minor and patch versions.
* Update `style.css`, `functions.php`, `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.

## Pull requests

* Give your pull request a descriptive title.
* Tag related issues (i.e. `Fixes #14`).

## Using Grunt

Run `grunt watch` before starting development. It will check your source files for errors, automatically fix many of them, and compile assets for you.

A precommit task will lint your PHP files.

### Assets (CSS, JavaScript and images)

Modify files in `assets/css/src` and `assets/js/src`. If you're not running `grunt watch`, you can lint and compile them manually with `grunt css`, `grunt js` or `grunt css-js`.

### SVGs

SVG files are not automatically minified. When you add a or modify and SVG file, run `grunt svg` _twice_.

### README

Modify `readme.txt`. After making changes, run `grunt readme` to update the markdown version (`readme.md`).
