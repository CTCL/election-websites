== Description ==

If youâ€™re a local election official in the United States, you can use this
template to get a head start on building your election website. The template
will provide you with (1) a pre-built home page with election-related links
and icons, (2) pre-loaded web pages on voting, voter registration, election
resources, and more. The template follows guidelines from the Center for
Civic Design and is fast, mobile-friendly and accessible.
